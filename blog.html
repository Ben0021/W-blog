    As crypto enthusiasts know well, and as anyone accustomed to the normal rules of finance can probably guess, Terra turned out to be neither safe nor high yield. The coin was a Ponzi scheme, critics say, the beginning of a collapse that sent Bitcoin prices plummeting and caused companies across the industry to hastily lay off employees and freeze customer withdrawals. Bitcoin is down nearly 70% from its peak in November, and the industry has named the downturn the crypto winter.

    This has been bad news for investors swept up in the frenzy, as well as for Binance itself. On May 16, Chief Executive Officer Changpeng Zhao disclosed the extent of Binance’s own Terra-related losses. The company’s stake had been worth $1.6 billion but was now worth close to zero. Not that Zhao was heeding or issuing any warnings. “So, there’s a couple of things about me,” he said in an interview that day. “I don’t really care much about it.

    The wait for Manchester United's final game of the season vs Crystal Palace is now down to nine days.

Ralf Rangnick's side are still reeling from yet another embarrassing defeat after they were hammered 4-0 by Brighton on Saturday, ensuring that they will register their lowest ever points tally in the Premier League era this season.

Meanwhile, Manchester City are closing in on the signing of Erling Haaland, ensuring that United once again miss out on the striker, while Karim Adeyemi has chosen to replace the Norweigan at Borussia Dortmund rather than move to Old Trafford.

The German's agent, Thomas Solomon, said: “We’re now close to completing the deal with Borussia Dortmund," he said, via Fabrizio Romano. "There will be no release clause included into his five-year deal."

“Rangnick? Yes, Manchester United wanted to enter the race - but we want BVB."<a href="https://www.google.com.ng/search?q=man+u+news&sxsrf=ALiCzsa1YfJGcBh1Z3wl8tFgwNK_F6Avd">continue reading.</a>

        Worried by the continuous strike by university teachers, aggrieved students, parents and stakeholders have called for the sack of the education minister, Adamu Adamu, saying his tenure is the worst so far in the history of the nation’s tertiary education.

They queried Adamu’s role in the negotiation process since the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) commenced on February 14 and insisted that the education minister has been insensitive to the plight of university students who have been at the receiving end over the years.

Some of the students in an interview with The Guardian appealed to the Federal Government to meet at least 50 per cent of ASUU demands to end the strike.
<br>
A 300-level student of the University of Lagos, Mathew Nwosu, said the ongoing strike was impacting negatively on the plans of Nigerian students.

He said although he enrolled for a five-year programme in 2017, he was still in the first semester of the third year because of ASUU’s incessant strike and the COVID-19 pandemic.

Nwosu lamented that some of his mates who left Nigeria to study abroad have graduated, while some are in their final year.

“You don’t expect students who spent most of their time on strike and who also studied without properly equipped laboratories to come out with good grades or become experts in their fields.

“I am appealing to the Federal Government to meet ASUU halfway in the interest of teeming Nigerian youths.<a href="http://127.0.0.1:5500/blog.html"><strong>Continue reading.</strong></a>
